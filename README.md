# GoTicTacToe
Tic-Tac-Toe programmed in Go.

This tic tac toe game is a little different. It is based off of basketball tic tac toe. This game has two players with 2 basketballs at opposite ends of the court. When the game starts, each player must make a layup. Once a player makes a layup, the player can grab the piece and run to the tic tac toe board located at the center of the court. The player places their piece down and runs back to their hoop to make another shot. The outcome of the game is determined by normal Tic-Tac-Toe strategies and how quickly one can make a shot.

##tictactoe.go
